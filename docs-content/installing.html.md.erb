This topic explains how to install and configure the Dynatrace Full-Stack Add-on for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='create-mfest'></a> Create the Dynatrace manifest

Follow these steps to create the Dynatrace manifest for your deployment:

1. Create a Dyntrace manifest file called `runtime-config-dyntrace.yml`, using the code below as a template to get started.
  <pre>releases:
  \- {name: dynatrace-oneagent, <strong>version</strong>: 0.3.3}<br>
  addons:
  \- name: dynatrace-oneagent-addon
      jobs:
      \- <strong>name</strong>: dynatrace-oneagent
        release: dynatrace-oneagent
      include:
        stemcell:
        \- <strong>os</strong>: ubuntu-trusty
      exclude:
        jobs:
        - {name: smoke-tests, release: cf}
        - {name: push-apps-manager, release: push-apps-manager-release}
        - {name: deploy-notifications, release: notifications}
        - {name: deploy-notifications-ui, release: notifications-ui}
        - {name: push-pivotal-account, release: pivotal-account}
        - {name: deploy-autoscaling, release: cf-autoscaling}
        - {name: register-broker, release: cf-autoscaling}
        - {name: nfsbrokerpush, release: nfs-volume}
        - {name: bootstrap, release: cf-mysql}
        - {name: rejoin-unsafe, release: cf-mysql}
        - {name: broker-registrar, release: cf-mysql}
        - {name: deregister-and-purge-instances, release: cf-mysql}
        - {name: smoke-tests, release: cf-mysql}
        - {name: install-hwc-buildpack, release: hwc-buildpack}
      properties:
        dynatrace:
          <strong>environmentid</strong>: &lt;environmentid&gt;
          <strong>apitoken</strong>: &lt;token&gt;
          <strong>apiurl</strong>: https://{your-managed-cluster.com}/e/{environmentid}/api
          starthelper: 1
  \#optional: extra addon configuration for Windows cells
  \- name: dynatrace-oneagent-windows-addon
      jobs:
      \- <strong>name</strong>: dynatrace-oneagent-windows
        release: dynatrace-oneagent
      include:
        stemcell:
        \- <strong>os</strong>: windows2012R2
      properties:
        dynatrace:
          <strong>environmentid</strong>: &lt;environmentid&gt;
          <strong>apitoken</strong>: &lt;token&gt;
          <strong>apiurl</strong>: https://{your-managed-cluster.com}/e/{environmentid}/api
  </pre>

2. Replace the values listed in the template as follows:
  * <code>releases: - version</code>: Specify the version number of your Dynatrace Full-Stack Add-on for PCF download from Pivotal Network.
  * <code>jobs: - name</code>: Don't change the name of this job. It must be `dynatrace-oneagent` for Linux VMs.
  * <code>include: stemcell - os</code>: Don't change the OS type.
  * <code>environmentid</code>: Replace with your Dynatrace environment ID.
  * <code>apitoken</code>: Replace with your PaaS token from the Dynatrace UI.
  * <code>apiurl</code>: Replace with your Dynatrace Managed URL, including environment ID. An example URL might look like the following: `https://{your-managed-cluster.com}/e/{environmentid}/api`

3. Optional: The add-on supports additional configuration properties:
  * <code>sslmode</code>: Set to `all` if you want to accept all self-signed SSL certificates.
  * <code>downloadurl</code> Specify a direct download URL for Dynatrace OneAgent. If this propertys set, BOSH will download OneAgent from this location.
  * <code>proxy</code>: Specify the proxy to be used for communication.

4. If you also want to deploy Dynatrace to Windows Diego cells, please configure a second add-on section for the `dynatrace-oneagent-windows` job. The properties for `environmentid`, `apitoken`, and `apiurl` remain the same as with the normal Linux configuration.
  * <code>jobs: - name</code>: For Windows cells this must be `dynatrace-oneagent-windows`.
  * <code>include: stemcell - os</code>: For Windows cells this must be `windows2012R2`.

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: To modify the configuration of an existing deployment, you must update the manifest file and redeploy.</p>


##<a id="download-deploy"></a>Download and deploy the Dynatrace Full-Stack Add-on for PCF

After deploying Ops Manager, perform the following steps to download and deploy the Dynatrace Full-Stack Add-on for PCF:

1. [Download the Dynatrace Full-Stack Add-on for PCF software binary](https://network.pivotal.io/products/dynatrace-fullstack-addon) from the Pivotal network to your local machine.

2. Copy the software binary to your Ops Manager instance.
<pre class="terminal">$ scp -i PATH/TO/PRIVATE/KEY dynatrace-release.tar.gz ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:</pre>

3. Copy the Dynatrace manifest file to your Ops Manager instance.
<pre class="terminal">$ scp -i PATH/TO/PRIVATE/KEY runtime-config-dyntrace.yml ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP:</pre>

4. SSH into Ops Manager.
 <pre class="terminal">$ ssh -i PATH-TO-PRIVATE-KEY ubuntu@YOUR-OPS-MANAGER-VM-IP</pre>

5. On the Ops Manager VM, navigate to the software binary location in your working directory.
<pre class="terminal">
$ cd PATH-TO-BINARY</pre>

6. On the Ops Manager VM, target the internal IP address of your BOSH Director. When prompted, enter your BOSH Director credentials. To retrieve your BOSH Director credentials, navigate to Ops Manager, click the **Credentials** tab, and click **Link to Credential** next to **Director Credentials**.
<pre class="terminal">
$ bosh --ca-cert /var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate target YOUR-BOSH-DIRECTOR-INTERNAL-IP
Target set to 'p-bosh'
Your username: director
Enter password: ******************
Logged in as 'director'
</pre>

7. Upload your release.
<pre class="terminal">$ bosh upload release PATH-TO-BINARY/dynatrace-release.tar.gz</pre>

8. Optionally, from the command line, you can confirm that upload of the Dynatrace software binary is complete. You should see the Dynatrace binary file.
<pre class="terminal">$ bosh releases</pre>

9. Update your runtime configuration to include the Dynatrace Add-on for PCF.
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: If you installed other BOSH add-ons, you must merge the Dynatrace manifest into your existing add-on manifest. Append the contents of <code>runtime-config-dyntrace.yml</code> to your existing add-on YML file.</p>
<pre class="terminal">$ bosh update runtime-config PATH/runtime-config-dyntrace.yml</pre>

10. Verify that your runtime configuration changes match what you specified in the Dynatrace manifest file.

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ bosh runtime-config
    Acting as user 'admin' on 'micro'

    releases:
    <span>-</span> {name: dynatrace-oneagent, version: 0.3.3}

    addons:
    <span>-</span> name: dynatrace-oneagent-addon
      jobs:
      <span>-</span> name: dynatrace-oneagent
        release: dynatrace-oneagent
    ...
    </pre>

11. Navigate to your **Installation Dashboard** in Ops Manager.

12. Click **Apply Changes**.
